## React Social Media Web App

This is a social media web application created with React. It allows users to sign up, login, make posts and comments, like posts and comments, and follow other people (to customize their newsfeed).

- Website communicates with a real-world backend API created with Node.js and Express.js using Axios and renders the data dynamically.
- Uses LocalStorage to store JWT token information, usernames, avatars, so users can remain logged in when they first sign in.
- Socket io was used for a live chat feature enabling users to communicate in real time.
- MongoDB Atlas was used as a Cloud Database for storing user information

Since this web application requires setup with MongoDB Atlas and other configurations, it's a hassle to run locally. I'll be deploying it online in a few days when the final product is complete.
