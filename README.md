## React Social Media Web App

**Please note:** This web application was built as part of an online React.js course I took while learning React. The finished product was deployed and can be found at this link: https://profound-figolla-298d5f.netlify.app/ - The hosting service used was free-tier so the performance is not optimal due to the server shutting down when inactive.

This is a social media web application created with React. It allows users to sign up, login, make posts and comments, like posts and comments, and follow other people (to customize their newsfeed).

- Website communicates with a real-world backend API created with Node.js and Express.js using Axios and renders the data dynamically.
- Uses LocalStorage to store JWT token information, usernames, avatars, so users can remain logged in when they first sign in.
- Socket io was used for a live chat feature enabling users to communicate in real time.
- MongoDB Atlas was used as a Cloud Database for storing user information.
