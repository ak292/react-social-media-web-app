## React Social Media Web App

**Please note:** This web application was built as part of an online React.js course I took while learning React.

This is a social media web application created with React. It allows users to sign up, login, make posts and comments, like posts and comments, and follow other people (to customize their newsfeed).

- Website communicates with a real-world backend API created with Node.js and Express.js using Axios and renders the data dynamically.
- Uses LocalStorage to store JWT token information, usernames, avatars, so users can remain logged in when they first sign in.
- Socket io was used for a live chat feature enabling users to communicate in real time.
- MongoDB Atlas was used as a Cloud Database for storing user information.

## Run

Since this project requires a lot of set up and back-end configuration to run (like setting up your own MongoDB Atlas account and DB), I decided to host it publically incase anyone would like to view it as opposed to placing instructions on how to run it locally.

The finished product was deployed and can be found at this link: https://profound-figolla-298d5f.netlify.app/ - The hosting service used was free-tier so the performance is not optimal due to the server shutting down and needing to restart when inactive.
